          <br>
          this is a website,mainly focused on helping out people who are <strong>NEW</strong> to coding and want to learn more about it, this particular website will link you videos,that get straight to the point and don't waste your time, and trust me they are really interesting and worth watching,this website is made with the help of Visial Studio Code (VSC) commonly
          used by a lot of programmers, to download this, you can
          <br>
